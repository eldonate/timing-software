this is my first try to create a timing software for my Alien RFID Reader ALR-9780

I am a newbie! Thanks for understanding

On the same directory with the compiled .exe file, you need to store the ftp_credentials.txt
There is also a folder called "examples" that have the files that should be present on the same directory as mentioned above.
